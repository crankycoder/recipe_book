# Garlic Scape and Basil Pesto

Toss the garlic scape and basil pesto with pasta or use it to top
potatoes, rice, salads, chicken, beef, pork, or slices of mozzarella
di buffalla. This pesto doesn't brown as fast as regular pesto, and it
freezes beautifully so you can enjoy it throughout the year.

## Ingredients

* 12 large garlic scapes, bulb removed, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1/2 cup)
* 1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil , divided and to taste
* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided and to taste
* 1/2 cup pine nuts , or walnuts


## Instructions 

1. Add the garlic scapes, basil, and kosher salt to a food processor or blender.
1. Pulse a couple of times to achieve a rough mixture.
1. Slowly start adding 1/2 cup of the olive oil.
1. Stop processing and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
1. The texture of the final pesto is up to personal taste. If the sauce seems too thick for your preference, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil at a time and check again for your ideal consistency.
1. Once a smooth paste has been achieved, add 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese and process until completely mixed in. Taste for seasonings.
1. Add the remaining cheese if you'd like a thicker and more savory paste, or leave as is if you're happy with the flavor and consistency so far.
1. Add the pine nuts and process at low speed until the nuts are roughly chopped and fully mixed in. The coarse nuts give the pesto a great texture.
1. Place the pesto in a serving bowl and refrigerate until ready to use. Top with a thin layer of olive oil and place in an airtight container if you're not consuming it right away.
