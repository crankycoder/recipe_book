Making pork bone broth is super easy. You’ll still need to make tare (broth seasoning) and aroma oil.**Ingredients:**  

- 3 lbs of pork feet sliced horizontally.
- 200g of yellow onion.
- 20g of smashed garlic cloves.
- 20g of ginger.
- 20g of full green onion (no need to slice)

**Steps:**  

- Boil pork feet in water until scum forms. Discard the water. Deep clean the bones under cold water.
- Then boil pork for 10 hours, top with water.
- Add all ingredients and continue to boil for 1 hour (do not overcook onion, they brown and will color your broth).
- **Strain on a fine mesh.**

If the boiling was too low, you won’t get the milky color. That’s okay, blend 1/3 of your ramen and mix with the rest.

If lower, keep reducing. If higher, slowly add water.Tare and aroma oil depend on what you are going after. I like mine to have a rich umami flavor, so it mixes kombu and bonito flakes. Ratio I use:

- 125g of noodles.
- 250g of broth.
- 30g of tare.
- 15g of aroma oil.
