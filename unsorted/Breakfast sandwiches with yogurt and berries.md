- 7 eggs, soft-boiled and sliced in half
- 1 loaf of high quality whole grain bread, presliced
- Fresh raspberries and blackberries 
- Greek yogurt 

-   2lbs (907g) 95% lean ground turkey or pork

-   1 tablespoon of sage (1g), finely chopped
-   1/2 teaspoon (2g) onion powder
-   2 teaspoons(8g) garlic powder
-   2 teaspoons (12g) fine sea salt
-   1/2 teaspoon(>1g) cayenne powder
-   1/2 teaspoon(>1g) black pepper

## Make the patties

- Mix spices and meat together until well mixed
- Make 7 balls
- Pan fry the balls 2 at a time in a little oil at medium high 
- You want to mash these down with a spatula when they hit the pan so you have flat sausages
- Cook for about 2 minutes so each side is browned and patty is cooked fully

Toast bread while this is happening. You'll need 14 slices of toast for 7 sandwiches.

## Assemble Sandwich

- Get your bread laid out with 7 slices
- Put your sauce down (I use HP steak sauce)
- Lay out a patty per slice
- Cut egg with sharp knife and place two halves yolk down on patty
- Cover with the other slice of bread. 
- Wrap tightly with saran wrap

## Assemble meal

- Put 2 large dollop of yogurt into small compartment  
- Put a handful of Berries in the other small compartment 
- Put wrapped sandwich into large area

You should heat the sandwich for 1 minute on high in microwave before you eat it.
