# Sous Vide Picanha


This is dead simple.

Mix your spice rub:

* 1 part smoked paprika (regular paprika is fine)
* 1 part garlic powder
* 1 part onion powder
* 1 part black pepper
* A couple sprigs of thyme (optional)



NO SALT!!!

Salt will cure your meat and make it tough. Stop being silly.

Prep:

* Trim the fat cap on your picanha if you're not into flavor.  People
  can always trim it off afterwards if they don't want it.
* Score your fat cap all the way to the meat in a grid about half an inch deep just to the meat.
* Get your rub all over your picanha on the meat side. The fat side doesn't really matter.
* Throw this into a foodsaver bag with your thyme
* Add a gob of butter if you want
* Vacuum seal
    

# Cooking:

* Cook @ 134F for *6 hours*. 
* Do not shave off time or this won't be nice and tender.
* Remove from bag and pat dry.  Surface moisture is your enemy.
    * I literally use disposable blue j-clothes
* Sear under a broiler for 2 min on each side, or in a bbq at >=450F

Rest for a min or two and cut across the grain.

Top this up with Chimicurri for garlicky goodness.
