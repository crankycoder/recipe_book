# Ingredients
-   1 pound dried navy beans
-   1 tablespoon salt
-   10-ounces (8 slices) thick-sliced bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
-   1 large onion, chopped
-   2 1/2 cups water
-   1/2 cup molasses
-   1/2 cup ketchup
-   1/4 cup packed brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon dry mustard
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

### Instructions

1.  Rinse the beans in a colander and sort through to remove any debris. Soak the beans overnight* in the pressure cooking pot with 8 cups of water and 1 tablespoon salt. 
2.  After soaking, drain and rinse the beans; discard the soaking liquid.
3.  Select Sauté and add the bacon to the pressure cooking pot. Cook until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. 
4.  Add the onion to the pot and cook in the bacon fat until tender, about 3 minutes. Scrape up brown bits on the bottom of the pot as the onions cook.
5.  Add 2 1/2 cups water, molasses, ketchup, brown sugar, dry mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to the onions and stir to combine. Stir in the soaked beans.
6.  Select high pressure and 35 minutes cook time. When the cook time ends, turn the pressure cooker off and do a 10 minute natural pressure release, followed by a quick pressure release to release any remaining pressure. Carefully remove the lid. 
7.  Discard any beans that are floating, and check several beans to make sure they're tender. If not, return to high pressure for a few more minutes. 
8.  Stir in the cooked bacon. Select Simmer and simmer beans uncovered, stirring occasionally so the bottom doesn't burn, until the sauce is the desired consistency.
