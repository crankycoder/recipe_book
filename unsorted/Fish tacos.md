Chipotle Crema
- 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt _(or mayo)_
-  1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce
-  1 tablespoon lime juice
-  1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt

The fish
- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 2 teaspoons chili powder*
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper
- 1 egg, whisked
- 1 1/2 pounds firm white fish, such as cod or halibut, cut into 2-inch pieces

Assembly 

- blend all the crema ingredients together and set aside
- mix all dry ingredients for fish
- dip fish into egg wash and coat with the dry mix. 
	- I use chopsticks to hold the fish here. Less mess and dry mix sticking to things that are not fish
- bake @ 375F for 5-7 minutes
